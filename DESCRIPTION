Description: Provides statistical process control tools for stochastic 
    textured surfaces. The current version supports the following tools:
    (1) generic modeling of stochastic textured surfaces.
    (2) local defect monitoring and diagnostics in stochastic 
        textured surfaces, which was proposed by Bui and Apley (2018a) 
        <doi:10.1080/00401706.2017.1302362>.
    (3) global change monitoring in the nature of stochastic 
        textured surfaces, which was proposed by Bui and Apley (2018b) 
        <doi:10.1080/00224065.2018.1507559>.
    (4) computation of dissimilarity matrix of stochastic textured 
        surface images, which was proposed by Bui and Apley (2019b)
        <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2019.01.019>.
